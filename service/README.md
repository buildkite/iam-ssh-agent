# iam-ssh-agent service

The `service` project is an AWS SAM project that deploys an API Gateway, lambdas
and a DynamoDB table.

The template can be deployed using the [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
or the AWS Serverless Application Repository [TBD].
